# Fundamentals

A selection of code examples that demonstrate a subset of foundational
computer science concepts. Each example is designed to be a readable
and complete demonstration of the topic it is covering.

These are divided up into sections based on the area of computer
science they would best be classified under. Following here is
checklist of topics that are on the roadmap for this project.

The choice of language for each topic is decided based on a few criteria:
* The language should be widely readable and understandable
* If the language's standard library has an implementation of the
  concept, the solution should not use it.

This is an early-stage project and the details of what it will
eventually contain are not finalized. They represent the author's
guess at some useful topics to cover.
