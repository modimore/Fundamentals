# Fundamentals

A selection of code examples that demonstrate a subset foundational
computer science concepts. Each example is designed to be a readable
and complete demonstration of the topic it is covering.

As of yet, a full description of the intended scope of this project
is in the works. However, implementations of a Dynamic Array and a
Linked List have been made in large part already.
They are in the Source/DataStructures for anyone who wants to check them out.

There is also an implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm in Source/Algorithms.
